
Map has neighbors on cells.  Is that useful?  The connection information lets
people move one unit at a time.
**We should force path generation or movement plan from actor client.  Then

What about reachability calculations and other math?
We need to let viewers query board for basic info.  Reachability calculations
need to be up to public information(not hidden info) and the unit that's moving.

Explicit connections allow game effects like "stairs" or "portals", that
ephemerally allow access to other locations.

How do we establish layout/connections and how are they used by movement?
Simple case is one region per move.  Simple.  check if region is connected.

What about the case of a knight in chess?  Can move in an L.  The ability to move
moves over obstructions and ignores normal region connectivity (though it must use
normal connectivity by moving in one mainline direction 2 then mainline perpendicular one.)
Bishops move diagonally.
There's also the concept of "free move", characters are free to move in any direction
one region/cell at a time like betrayal at house on the hill.

Ask engine about map layout?

Ask engine for all move patterns to read a particular cell given a particular Unit
Ask engine for all possible destination cells
Ask engine for all possible move patterns through a particular cells

Automatic annealing of many map segments into a universal grid where the invalid locations are simply non-existent.  E.G. the rooms joined together in gloomhaven

On the Topic of region annealing/joining.  There may be a desire for automatic region filling between the pieces when the voids are completely encircled by surrounding tiles
This is the case for scenario 3 of gloomhaven
