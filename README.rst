===================
BoardGame Framework
===================

A framework for implementing boardgames.

The idea is that the components here can be used with game specific modules that
import and use or simply "configure-together" game components with config files.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

1. Why this directory structure?
      https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/#the-structure

2. Why only python3?
      I didn't want to deal with compatibility.

3. Why Sphinx/restructured text instead of markdown?
      Ultimately because restructured text is more flexible and it is automatically usable
      by readthedocs.  Also, http://www.zverovich.net/2016/06/16/rst-vs-markdown.html.

4. Why Apache2 license?
      I want people to be able to do pretty much whatever they want.  But want to protect
      the project itself.
